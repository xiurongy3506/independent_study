Hi!  
I am Xiurong Yu, a current student at High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technolgy. As a senior in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/), I am in the unit of Independent Study, where I am given 9 weeks to study what interests me. In this repository, I will be blogging on my Learn-On-Your-Own experiences and takeaways. Blogs will be updated weekly and please feel free to explore!
